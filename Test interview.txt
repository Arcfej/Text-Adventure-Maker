Miklos Mayer
Hey. Uh, no thanks for buying. No applying applying for anything that you and I would introduce my oral project again just to remind you, so I will create a.

Miklos Mayer
Application that.

Miklos Mayer
Though I think although I targeting NONPROGRAMMERS but.

Miklos Mayer
The idea is that uh making textual adventure games creation easier, but for.

Miklos Mayer
People who would like to tell a story.

Miklos Mayer
And either or textual adventure game or or internal branching stories or interruptive stories.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
For that I'm collecting the requirements now and, uh, trying to.

Miklos Mayer
Interview anyone?

Miklos Mayer
Likes to write or create stories. For example, I have DND Masters to interview. I also have a hopefully some writers or drama.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
Graduates and someone who just like you, would have to tell stories or want to create a game so.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Ren
A fun fact I also used to be a dungeon DND dungeon master.

Miklos Mayer
OK, then you can talk about that too.

Miklos Mayer
Alright.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Because uh first. So there are two parts for this interview, one for.

Miklos Mayer
Exploring.

Miklos Mayer
Umm how you create all your creative process or how you?

Miklos Mayer
Uh bright stories. And then we I will show you some examples for programs that.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
Kind of builds 4 deaths or tools for making.

Miklos Mayer
Programming more accessible for people.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that. That's too bad. So let's start with.

Miklos Mayer
How do you create an?

Miklos Mayer
Umm, it doesn't have to be but.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
And let.

Miklos Mayer
So we we can focus on stories or story creation, but it doesn't have to necessarily.

Ren
Ohh.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, be that.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
Any kind of?

Miklos Mayer
So so the question is, how do you create and what you create and?

Ren
Well.

Miklos Mayer
How?

Ren
When I when I start thinking about.

Ren
Stories I tend to 1st think of characters that I want to implement in the stories. I like to think of personalities that I think would be fun to.

Ren
Make interact together so.

Ren
It'll usually start with like a main side character that I would like that I kind of want a main character to interact with and then build a main character off of that and then.

Ren
I'll start thinking of.

Ren
Events that I would like to happen in this story.

Ren
And then think around smaller events that would lead to those events. So in reality, I start with the characters first.

Ren
Create events around interactions between those characters and then somehow fill the gaps between big events happening.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
So you're saying that you start with planning and then stuck, right? Or is this? Is there a location when it's the opposite when you just had an idea and write it down and?

Ren
Uh, I'm.

Miklos Mayer
The whole story, get out of it or.

Ren
I I might write small details about if, for instance, if I think about event that I enjoy it like then I will write down some details about it. But I will usually think of an event 1st and then write it out after.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
Uh, yeah, I usually plot I I even use flow charts in some occasions to uh.

Ren
Before I even begin properly writing anything out.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
And uh, so you're using this for?

Miklos Mayer
DND or stories or?

Ren
This is this is.

Miklos Mayer
You write small numbers.

Ren
This is for the visual novel. I'm like to make for for DND. I tend to follow like I've not really written too much of my own, but.

Ren
Uh, because for D&D, I'm more of a.

Ren
Dungeon Master that just goes with the flow I tend to.

Ren
Plan events.

Ren
Such as fights and stuff like that and then.

Ren
Structured them and then somehow and because the problem with DND is that you want to leave a lot to the players rather than.

Ren
Plan everything out. I don't find it writing down for the India. Is that helpful for me?

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Miklos Mayer
OK, so have you written any Michelle Novas yet?

Ren
Uh.

Ren
I've not written anything fully, I've only written very small segments.

Miklos Mayer
Alright. And and that's a.

Ren
Yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
That you mentioned that how you like to create that that this is what you put it into?

Ren
Yeah, like I said, I'll create a flow chart first. So I have an idea of what events could happen before what events would.

Ren
Happen after and then I write start writing about what's going on in those events.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Usually in Google Docs.

Miklos Mayer
Ah, yeah, yeah. That's why one of my next question, that's what's also have to use and.

Ren
Yeah. So.

Miklos Mayer
And and actually, do you use a computer or phone or both or notebook?

Ren
I I prefer a computer because I like the size of it, especially because I don't just use word, I also like I say use flow charts.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
And for that I use something like uh draw IO I believe.

Ren
And the but The thing is, because I'm making a video game visual novel for me, having that flow chart is very important so that.

Ren
It's.

Ren
When I actually.

Ren
Get to building it and for someone to enjoy. I I I know which like.

Ren
Which event has to come first? Which has to come second? Stuff like that, especially with branching choices.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Ohh.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Uncle.

Ren
Yeah, I'm just. It's fine.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Thanks.

Miklos Mayer
Umm have you ever?

Miklos Mayer
I assume you paid this vision of us or before.

Ren
Yes, yes.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, and uh. Do you have a?

Miklos Mayer
That's great. You like? And what do you like in them or?

Ren
Ohh.

Ren
I'm gonna say one of the more popular ones that I enjoyed was, uh, hatoful boyfriend, which is a pigeon dating simulator.

Miklos Mayer
I've heard of it.

Ren
With psychological horror elements, once you actually get through all of that.

Ren
It was quite it it as the game, it's quite something.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
It had branching choices and multiple endings, and like I said, one, once you unlocked all the endings, you can.

Ren
You unlock, you unlock like the special secret ending which starts going into this horrible psychological Horror Story, which was very intriguing. I have to say it.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Interesting.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
OK. And have you played textual adventure games, which I think differ in a way that?

Ren
They don't tend to have images I believe.

Miklos Mayer
I mean, in general textual, I mean, in general adventure games are.

Miklos Mayer
More.

Miklos Mayer
So there's a word you can walk around or move around and you know my inventory, you have to solve puzzles. So the simplest version of a.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Adventure game could be a escape room, for example, but if you have.

Miklos Mayer
It's not that important.

Miklos Mayer
Be more complicated, but.

Miklos Mayer
So that's a different storytelling approach I think. But is that something you are?

Miklos Mayer
Interested in or?

Ren
Uh, I mean to the.

Miklos Mayer
Played any?

Ren
To the green because of visual novels are kind of.

Ren
Us very similar genre to that, especially because some of them come with mini games that have elements of adventure based texture games.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Miklos Mayer
Textual.

Ren
Text texture games. That's not that's not right. Textures and text is not is. Yeah, textural that there there we go.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Ren
I hope I have played a few games.

Ren
Where it was just basically text to navigate.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
The world around you as well, like uh, and so you like. It will describe a world to you. And the only way to move through that world would be you physically typing out. Move north or something like that as.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh I see yeah.

Miklos Mayer
And the you enjoy that or you found that.

Ren
Uh, it was quite nice.

Ren
Especially when games like that actually develop like some shortcuts into how to move for instance, instead of moving north if you pressed. I don't know, control N, it'll just automatically do that anyway, because it's a thing you can repeat all the time.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Miklos Mayer
OK, that's interesting.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
I'm just checking my questions.

Ren
I remember how that was.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, but the and do you have any other?

Miklos Mayer
You want to add to.

Miklos Mayer
Special adventure game so physical.

Ren
When it comes.

Miklos Mayer
Which one of us or?

Miklos Mayer
These countries.

Ren
Sorry, can you repeat that?

Miklos Mayer
Or to these genres.

Ren
Uh.

Ren
I don't know.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
I mean, in general prefer any games and stuff like that. That's rely on story. So you know, all of that is just text in a matter.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
What? What's what? What I think is nice that sometimes that occurs in and always occurs in visual novels, but sometimes occurs in other media as well as when you can go over previous logs.

Miklos Mayer
Alright.

Ren
Of what you've done in a text based game.

Ren
Like you can.

Ren
You can be in at the end of Chapter 2 and you can read all the way to the beginning of what everything that you've done and see the choices that you've made. I've always found that to be quite useful.

Miklos Mayer
OK, so you like the this notebook or diary?

Miklos Mayer
Teacher.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a. Yeah. Like a log, really.

Miklos Mayer
App.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, it probably can be implanted in multiple ways.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's that's good. Thanks.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Ren
Oh, and of course, something that's.

Ren
For when it comes to text based games, music can be quite important as well.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
Like depending on what your visuals are.

Ren
You like you.

Ren
When people play games, you're engaging 3 senses visual.

Ren
Auditory and well.

Ren
In a way, even tactile, if you're moving around the screen.

Ren
So I I do think it's kind of important to make to make the sounds quite nice. I don't know if you.

Ren
For instance Undertale you is a like RPG that you can technically fight in it, but you don't actually have to fight in that game at all. But what they did with their sound design is that every character just had a different like text noise.

Ren
That was quite.

Miklos Mayer
Ah.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Miklos Mayer
OK, let's end interesting, Elia.

Miklos Mayer
Umm yeah, thanks for mentioning that.

Ren
I'm I'm I'm giving you some stretch goals here.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, probably.

Ren
I mean, look, it's good that that's something to write about when you'll need to.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's true.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's true.

Miklos Mayer
I don't know. It's uh.

Miklos Mayer
Make me thinking.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, you mentioned that you were like to write on the OR on the.

Miklos Mayer
Umm.

Miklos Mayer
Computer because the bigger screen. But is it important to you to have the app available on Mobile 2?

Miklos Mayer
And and they.

Ren
Umm for me, I I I think occasionally it would be good for me because I sometimes when I'm out and about I'll see something, I'll hear something I'll get about of inspiration and it's just good to have.

Ren
And I always have my phone with me, so it's good to have some place where I can write it down. So when I or note it down and then when I get back to my PC, I can fully explore it.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
And is it would you like?

Miklos Mayer
So for example, if you were.

Miklos Mayer
If then you will create your visual novel. Would you like to use the same program for that or.

Miklos Mayer
Or taking a different note.

Miklos Mayer
Taking.

Miklos Mayer
Salter.

Ren
For my visual novel, I actually wouldn't mind using it to generate all the text that I need for it, but because my visual novel is something I want to code from scratch.

Ren
It's going to be its own software.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh OK.

Ren
But if it could, if it could be used to just generate all the necessary texts, that would go into the game, that would actually be a huge help for that kind of thing.

Miklos Mayer
So you mean building up the?

Ren
Yes, yes.

Miklos Mayer
Uh branching story, but the conversations and have that.

Ren
Yes.

Miklos Mayer
OK, I I have a few ideas. One that's for you. I will tell you after doing tell you.

Ren
Fair enough.

Miklos Mayer
But what I found during my research.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Thanks.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
Sorry, checking my questions again.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Ren
No problem. Take your time.

Miklos Mayer
So I think that's all I have in regarding.

Miklos Mayer
Creative.

Miklos Mayer
Uh processes or work, or how you would approach it.

Miklos Mayer
Do you have anything to?

Ren
So.

Miklos Mayer
Can't remember to one 200.

Ren
No, no, I can't think of anything at the moment.

Miklos Mayer
OK, in that case I will jump to the next section where I will show you a few things I discovered and.

Miklos Mayer
I am.

Miklos Mayer
I would like to have your opinion on it or what do you like in the program, but you doesn't like? What do you miss?

Ren
What I don't like OK UX.

Miklos Mayer
But do you miss?

Miklos Mayer
Yes, mostly.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Ren
I love me some UX.

Miklos Mayer
Not this, actually. This is a game that's.

Miklos Mayer
If you're interested, I can show it. I just set it here as an example. That's what kind of though this has a.

Miklos Mayer
Sound.

Ren
To.

Miklos Mayer
I don't. I'll tell you now, but.

Ren
I I mean see sound is very important. I'm just saying.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, it just I was surprised and it's louder than you, so.

Miklos Mayer
So basically this is a textual adventure game where you have inventory you can.

Miklos Mayer
Give commands by clicking buttons and tears. Someone you talk to class about different things you can.

Miklos Mayer
Open filing cabinets.

Ren
What was your actions? Are. Yeah, that that looks quite nice.

Miklos Mayer
And there's the.

Miklos Mayer
What's happening?

Ren
The log.

Miklos Mayer
Nothing follows out. You can. Yeah, you can take the revolver and you can fire the revolver.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, which is?

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
No. OK.

Miklos Mayer
As everyone want to fire us, think in their office. Yeah. So this is a detective story and has a.

Miklos Mayer
Interface like that. So here is a.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
I quite like that. That's quite nice.

Miklos Mayer
Doctor.

Miklos Mayer
Now what?

Miklos Mayer
Right, right, right. And put the trigger, I found a bug.

Ren
Yeah. So, so, so, so no. So you, you, you, you fired the revolver and then when you pulled the trigger, you realized it was a gun shaped lighter rather than a revolver. So now it's.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh.

Ren
So now when you repeat the action with the lighter, you just get the same text.

Miklos Mayer
Oh, my God. OK.

Ren
Fun.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, yeah, so this is one kind of adventure game and which is more interactive or I mean.

Miklos Mayer
Umm.

Miklos Mayer
It's not just choices in the story, but uh yeah, we probably played one of these. This is tractor actually interactive story so.

Miklos Mayer
That you.

Miklos Mayer
I don't know those.

Ren
This kind of reminds me of the fallen London Games and stuff like that, except that's like a lot, those are like.

Ren
Oh, let me see if I can find that and send you the link for those.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Yes.

Ren
Those used to be quite popular games, but they weren't quite.

Miklos Mayer
Ah.

Ren
Their text based browser games and there's like a bunch of things like that.

Ren
I'll send you the link so you have that.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Yeah. So this is a story and you have different.

Miklos Mayer
Choices here and there.

Miklos Mayer
And you can probably die sometimes. I don't have the pension not to read it.

Ren
Yeah, fair enough.

Miklos Mayer
But yeah, so this is an ohh instead.

Ren
That.

Ren
Your dad.

Miklos Mayer
Am I dead? No. It's someone else's. OK. Yeah. So this is a another kind of game. But let's move on to the.

Ren
A bit simpler, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
But let's move. So this is just branching story, basically.

Miklos Mayer
So let's move on to the programs that you can use to write these. This is the first one I prepared with and is trying, but I did in I will show you free programs and but I.

Miklos Mayer
Uh did is create a simple scenario in every program, the same scenario.

Ren
Mm-hmm.

Miklos Mayer
So that it could be compared. So here I have a no. This is something that.

Miklos Mayer
I just thought it during the last interview.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
OK, so uh.

Miklos Mayer
So first I saw the scenario is that you wake up in a room with them.

Miklos Mayer
Empty inventory so.

Miklos Mayer
This is just the start to get the inventory and then go to room. So this has a scripting language kind of.

Ren
Mm-hmm.

Miklos Mayer
And if.

Miklos Mayer
So if I go to the room.

Miklos Mayer
He woke up with keys in your inventory. Then we see. Yeah.

Ren
See your table with a key.

Ren
Mm-hmm.

Miklos Mayer
He is not in the inventory. You see a table with the key on it. As you will see an empty table and there's a door on the right. And if there is nothing they inventory can be done, have the option to become the key or open the door. And if I run this.

Miklos Mayer
It's actually something like this. Then you also have a debugger.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
But if I try to open the door now, it's has the option that the door is locked.

Miklos Mayer
And I can just take me back here.

Miklos Mayer
And if I pick up the key?

Miklos Mayer
Uh, the option is not there. You see another table.

Miklos Mayer
And now if I open the door, I escaped.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
So implementing the inventory is wasn't straightforward.

Ren
Umm.

Miklos Mayer
Writing the script is easier, but you can do here is.

Miklos Mayer
I think there are highlights here.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, so there are.

Ren
Mm-hmm.

Miklos Mayer
But what types that, uh explains the things, and I found that useful. Or this is not explained.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. UM, and what I other thing you can do is.

Ren
OK. Yeah, I can see that being quite useful. Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Is for example, I don't to insert and if here and you have some options that you can use. For example the player visitor to message.

Miklos Mayer
Exactly. I don't know two times.

Ren
Mm-hmm.

Miklos Mayer
Five times. So then see secret room can be open, for example. So if I this then.

Miklos Mayer
He stacked it appear, or if I put it into double.

Ren
An action.

Miklos Mayer
Ah, square brackets that needs to be an options link. You can click, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Miklos Mayer
This is, yeah, and this is the vendor script which just checks if he is in the inventory or not and then it's creates something that you go back to the room.

Ren
OK, that seems simple enough, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
It's using fairly simple language.

Miklos Mayer
And so this is on.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, and I'm sorry this will take that. If Kay is in inventory, so you can, it's almost like reading English.

Ren
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the that's what I'm saying, using very simple language, which.

Ren
Sounds like it would be quite understandable.

Ren
And if even if it's not like you said, you can highlight things and it explains it to you, which is quite nice, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So any other opinion on it or?

Miklos Mayer
Uh, there's something you missed or don't like, like.

Ren
Does it have like a tutorial when it starts to teach you these things?

Ren
Or does it just throw you in there? No.

Miklos Mayer
Not in the program.

Ren
Well, in the program, so it only has like a tutorial on a video or something like that.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
That is a cook book.

Miklos Mayer
I think where there are examples and everything.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Miklos Mayer
Common questions comment.

Ren
OK.

Ren
OK. Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Things started our story. Yeah. So there's a tutorial here how to write this.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So the idea is that you can see the flow of the story by the by this graph.

Ren
Yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Ren
It's basically a flow chart of some sort.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, it is.

Miklos Mayer
Umm.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Any other?

Miklos Mayer
I'm Russians or?

Ren
Ohh.

Miklos Mayer
I think you'll notice.

Ren
Maybe because I'm already a programmer, it's not too complicated for me, but like like I said, the only thing I was worried about is does it actually have a place where it does explain what's happening?

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
But it does. So yeah, that's the only thing I could think of that I'm noticing, but otherwise, no. I like the use of. I like the visual use it has.

Ren
Of the of the flow charts structure, because I feel like that's always useful to.

Ren
Kinda keep scope of where your story is going and what needs to happen or doesn't need to happen.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Thanks.

Miklos Mayer
And in that case I move forward to the next program.

Miklos Mayer
Which is quest, which is a different approach because it's a form base.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
Interface. So here you have.

Miklos Mayer
Basically an object tree.

Miklos Mayer
Umm, you can have different kind of objects, so for example.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
You have fun room.

Miklos Mayer
UM, you can set up a different things.

Miklos Mayer
So a description for the room.

Miklos Mayer
You can set up. It exits between different look rooms or locations. So for here I I have another room called escaped and I opened the.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, so for example, if I.

Miklos Mayer
We have a new one.

Miklos Mayer
Oh yeah, it would be one or two directional looks like.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So it creates an exit, which is also what object type.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
Yep. So the room has objects in it, so the player is in it.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, I'm gonna make things visible.

Miklos Mayer
Inanimate object pairs and inanimate object. Interesting and.

Miklos Mayer
You can add, uh, verbs that can use so because this game can be used. Actually this one is.

Miklos Mayer
Ah.

Miklos Mayer
Return visits this program too.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
But.

Miklos Mayer
Here in the basic version you can type. So for example pick pick up the yeah.

Ren
Yeah, you just, you just have a basic setup of it, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, the but also have a use. You can drop the key.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Or you can look at the table or.

Ren
Yeah. So so it it gives you more options than the previous ones on first glance.

Ren
But.

Ren
I I had the UI for it is I I'm not the biggest fan of it.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, this, I mean the pain or the the creator.

Miklos Mayer
Oh, I see.

Ren
I mean the the, the, the creation, the Creator cause I'm. I'm imagine that the the screen that you had there where you dropped the key and stuff. I pretty sure you can change that probably.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, I'm. I go there. So for example, I set this up to be a container and if I click on it, it will appear and this is a surface, which means that visible immediately. You don't have to open it.

Miklos Mayer
You cannot. Verbs. That's what's the what.

Miklos Mayer
What can you do with that?

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
For object for example, you can.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, object can be dropped or not.

Ren
I like.

Miklos Mayer
Now set up a lot of things.

Ren
I like the option that this gives you like it gives you a lot of options, but I really don't like the ways it gives you those options. It's.

Ren
It doesn't feel very easy to grasp like the other one. The other one feels like it's a lot quicker to grasp a lot easier to figure out where everything is.

Ren
This doesn't feel like it's very intuitive.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Yes.

Ren
Like that? That that's me as a programming person is a maybe I'm biased on the one that's using a bit more programming language, but I I'm having a hard time understanding what you use on its own might OK, maybe it means that you can use one the item without another item and then use on other object on this? OK kinda get what's going on here, but it's still.

Ren
It's a bit clunky.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
I like that it gives you those options and that it specifies them, but.

Ren
It's not very easy to grasp immediately.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, I'm not sure this is how you cannot.

Miklos Mayer
Different scripts, for example.

Miklos Mayer
There's a lot of precepts, babes.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh what are you stored on the key so use with other objects. This was yeah it will unload the exit.

Ren
Yeah. And I'm like, I see it also use like a file structure as well.

Miklos Mayer
Yes. So for example objects here it is not OK actually.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
And or keep first time.

Miklos Mayer
Said object like. Yeah, so it does a lot of things you can do.

Miklos Mayer
The packets.

Miklos Mayer
Find yourself so.

Miklos Mayer
This is how you ask it sound.

Ren
All right.

Miklos Mayer
I don't know what happens here.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, and and then it's become a a form again.

Ren
It's in. It's, it's interesting. It's a good it's a good visual way of like depicting what should go where, I guess.

Miklos Mayer
I'd like to get this.

Ren
What's this? See, even you are struggling.

Miklos Mayer
Yes.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
I don't know how it is, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
OK, this is how you did. Great. Yeah. Although it has the.

Miklos Mayer
Ability to.

Miklos Mayer
Switch to.

Ren
Switch to code.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, which is a big sum up is something.

Ren
OK. Yeah, that doesn't look any that, yeah, that doesn't quite look any easier to me.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, it's just for the ability to copy paste things and.

Ren
Yeah, I can see that. OK. That makes sense. Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
I mean, I know, I know. I program in Windows Forms, but I do that in C#, not in XAML, so I'm still I'm. I'd stay away from that one still.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
That one looks that still looked painful to me.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, and and you can modify the lot of textbooks can be done anywhere.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Like I said, no, I like the amount of options this gives you. That's fantastic, especially as someone who This is why I'm programming my own game rather than using preexisting stuff, because there's lots of stuff that exists, like renpy and et cetera.

Ren
But because I want to put more stuff in there that.

Ren
That I.

Ren
Because they have the programming knowledge and I want to put more stuff in there than those programs offer me. I'm just doing it.

Ren
But yeah, in any case more choice for stuff like this is always a positive.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Umm.

Ren
Like I said, the only problem I have with it is the presentation and.

Ren
The way things are kind of layered here.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Thanks. And yeah, they actually have a documentation too.

Miklos Mayer
To tomorrow, all times, lot of things.

Ren
Ohh that I I like. That's a very nice documentation.

Miklos Mayer
Come on, Sara. Sweet shores. That's just not the how to a lot of common.

Miklos Mayer
Solutions or problems?

Ren
And very basic coding help, yeah.

Ren
Can you press one of them?

Miklos Mayer
Uh, yes. So for example show map. Let's see.

Miklos Mayer
So it's possible.

Ren
You see, I this this looks like a very nice look. Like a nice looking tutorial to me. Then what? The other one had going? Because it's just it's there. It's showing everything you need.

Ren
And very big.

Ren
Texts very very big text, very big pictures.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, there are some.

Ren
But like I said, the only thing that I I really don't like how the UI on this one looks that's.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
I'll yeah.

Ren
I can only reiterate the same point over and over at this point.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. OK.

Miklos Mayer
I just.

Miklos Mayer
OK, let's go to the next one. Have you used?

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
You only this visual scripting.

Ren
I have at one point not for very long, but uh.

Ren
I still ended up normally scripting at the end of it.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, I see.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, because, uh, another.

Miklos Mayer
Umm, so you should or direction I can imagine is to have something which is completely graphics to.

Miklos Mayer
I mean, this is too complicated because it's designed for.

Ren
Yeah.

Ren
Yeah.

Ren
I mean, yeah, no, it's.

Miklos Mayer
Graphical games, but I I I can imagine that the simplified version of it would be useful for creating textual adventure games.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Ren
This is what I told you before about the whole flow charts are very helpful. Visual aids for figuring out which direction you're story is going in.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Ren
But yeah, some of simplified version of this.

Ren
Would look very would, I think be very useful.

Miklos Mayer
OK, any idea how we would simplify this or?

Miklos Mayer
Uh, because you already used, probably more than me, so.

Ren
Well, no, I I I didn't trust me, but considering I am an expert at flowcharts, for instance the if statement that says true false, you can very much.

Ren
Just make different types of arrows to signify those.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
Or.

Ren
Like let's say green arrow for true red arrow for false, just as a basic example.

Ren
Because then then you'll know immediately. OK, this this scene has two outcomes, and that generates those two arrows. It makes it a bit less cluttered in that case.

Miklos Mayer
And for the switch state and you can be multi colored or that something, I mean I I'd be the Switch statement instead of a choice because basically this is a choice so.

Ren
I mean, yeah.

Ren
I ohgi I love me. Some switch statements, OK.

Ren
But a.

Miklos Mayer
But yeah, but this is the same scenario. Basically only other thing I have is here the inventory.

Ren
In for instance in in float in float charts.

Ren
Like if you look at like common flow charts, an if statement would be a diamond instead of a rectangle. That and the diamond would say.

Ren
Uh can open door, no, yes.

Miklos Mayer
Alright, so you would, uh.

Ren
And like and the arrows would be no, yes.

Miklos Mayer
So you would change the shape of the blocks you're saying.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Yes, it doesn't have to be. It's a very good visual aid to help you like on first glance. See. OK. Yeah, you don't need to read everything out. You don't necessarily even need to make it a different visual block. You can make it a different color.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Like anything, that's a switch can be like in this example. This is orange at the moment, so every switch statement is an orange box and all out of a switch statement. There's always a yes, like a couple of arrows that.

Ren
Are different than type to signify the yes, no maybe.

Ren
Outcomes.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
That's.

Miklos Mayer
That's a good, good idea.

Miklos Mayer
Thank you.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, and I find it. That's.

Miklos Mayer
The option is.

Miklos Mayer
Strange that. Yeah, I mean, this is a condition and you have two things that comes into it, but it's so long.

Ren
Quite, quite, quite, quite honestly. Quite honestly, look into flow chart diagrams and like the symbol meanings for them.

Miklos Mayer
Now.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
That I think that could help you out quite a bit if you if you want to make a flow chart.

Ren
Thing in your thing.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
And would you?

Miklos Mayer
Would you like to use a graph only for visualization or actually to be able to change it and change the?

Ren
Yes.

Miklos Mayer
Umm so for example in fine this is just a visualization, you cannot modify the.

Miklos Mayer
A flow. The flow of the story by.

Miklos Mayer
Dragging, dropping.

Miklos Mayer
On this.

Miklos Mayer
Blueprints. That's what it blueprint. But here you can actually.

Miklos Mayer
Create new things.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, that, that I actually creates code. Yes. OK.

Ren
Uh.

Ren
I I mean if I'm creating a simpler game like the ones you've shown me and like falling on, I think I wouldn't mind.

Ren
That these things generate code.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Actually, I think in general I wouldn't mind if they generate code.

Ren
Because you can always, because for me, I can. I can always go edit it later for myself, but.

Ren
That's me. I'm weird. I'm a Collider.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, I see.

Ren
I I'm not your usual use case.

Ren
But I I think if I didn't know how to code, I was using these things to make the game for me anyway. Then yes, I would want it to not be just a visual presentation, but to also be the thing that makes it for me.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Any other questions?

Miklos Mayer
Umm, actually that's make me want to show you the. I'm not sure if you seen it.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, what's the name of it?

Miklos Mayer
I think.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, this is it. So this is a game maker's own version of.

Miklos Mayer
Or.

Ren
OK, of the unity.

Miklos Mayer
No, sorry.

Ren
Of the unity one.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So it's a, it's more like a, it's less less flow charity, it's more like a mix of forms like in quest and this.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
So it has a. You can also drag and drops different actions here, then they will.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, be connected and you can see it in the tree here. How they go after each other, which is color-coded and also every.

Miklos Mayer
Kind of action has a.

Miklos Mayer
Icon for them.

Miklos Mayer
I mean, this is also for graphical games, so it's.

Miklos Mayer
You have a something graphical and you attach an event so it and then the you create the code for the events here.

Ren
OK. Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
But.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, if I pull to that?

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So it will create something like this. I will things go after each other so.

Miklos Mayer
I'm not sure. Do you have any opinion on this, how it could be used for extra adventure games? I mean, yeah, it's it's it could be event based.

Ren
I mean, it's very similar to the unity one I guess.

Miklos Mayer
You know.

Ren
Which just like I I I feel like all the all these like.

Ren
Flow charts can I mean it depends on what? What kind of person is also like. If you have a visual person.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Then to them the flow chart will be very, very, very like much easier to use, but if you have a person who's more.

Ren
Tech space, I guess.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
They might prefer something along with, like what quests offers just.

Ren
Please, for the love of God, if you make something like that, make the UI nicer cause that that's.

Miklos Mayer
Nicer than this, this game maker.

Ren
It's getting like her.

Miklos Mayer
Or or the the trying one.

Ren
The quest one the the.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh the question OK.

Ren
Yeah, that, that I hate that. I mean, I cannot express to you how much I hate it.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
That makes sense.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So.

Ren
I'll.

Miklos Mayer
OK. I just wanted to show you this, but yeah.

Ren
I'll. I'll have you know that the engine that I am using to code my game does also have visual scripting.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Which one is that?

Ren
It's called godeaux.

Miklos Mayer
Oh, God. Oh yeah. Although they they start.

Ren
Yeah, they're they're a bit more programming. They're a bit more programming.

Miklos Mayer
That there's staff supporting the.

Miklos Mayer
Uh for visual scripting?

Ren
Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
OK. I just wanted to show you this, but.

Miklos Mayer
Actually this is the free program I prepared to with this scenario to I haven't donated to G ML or any others.

Ren
OK. Yeah, yeah, fair enough. No problem.

Miklos Mayer
But it.

Ren
You only have so much time with each of your interviewees.

Miklos Mayer
Yes.

Miklos Mayer
So I mean, we are meeting the end of it, but.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, I just want to. I I I'm, I'm sure this.

Miklos Mayer
Keeps going this.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, it's actually permission on over us. So I'm not sure if you heard of it.

Ren
Tuesday JS.

Miklos Mayer
Yes.

Miklos Mayer
So it's also more official so.

Miklos Mayer
You have a.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, you you have scenes.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
And and then uh.

Miklos Mayer
The scene has a.

Ren
OK. Legacy choice. Yeah, that makes sense.

Ren
Yeah. That like I said.

Miklos Mayer
Background image, music, etcetera. Color, size, position and set up a lot of things.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Like I said that there are other apps as well like renpa, I and.

Ren
I think he even gave what was the name game maker like? I don't know.

Ren
15 at this point, there's so many of them.

Ren
They're all great at making visual novels and also like RPG games.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
But there are a bit too limiting to me, which is why I'm using Godot to make it from scratch basically, but there are they're all very useful and for like visual novels it's a good thing to look at if you want to.

Ren
See about adding images to the text space adventures.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, actually you have an editor here where you can grab it.

Ren
Yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Drag and dropped the different elements. Why elements?

Ren
I like the UI on that one looks very.

Ren
Apple.

Miklos Mayer
Ah, OK.

Ren
I I may not be the biggest fan of Apple, but their UI is quite quite clean.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Actually I.

Miklos Mayer
I find it hard to.

Miklos Mayer
Realize what's in what here and how they connect with each other and what's after what.

Ren
Uh, So what I'm guessing is this is them using it? Is that at that looks like a phone.

Miklos Mayer
No, this is the.

Ren
Yeah, I'm.

Miklos Mayer
This is a desktop screenshot.

Ren
That's the that's all that's that's how I I don't like that. But I like how the buttons look.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
Yeah, I'm. I'm not. I'm not saying the usability is good. I'm saying I like how it looks.

Miklos Mayer
Alright.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So you can add it.

Ren
And like if you see on like these pictures on like the right side, you have like these options that are like.

Ren
Clearly like a line art. You see that it has like a nice.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Ren
Picture on how you can actually align it around. That's.

Ren
Like his uh, then again, I'm a visual person, so to me that's always a nice extra.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. So.

Ren
He had duplicate cuts. They all have little pictures on them as well.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's what you put in the arts. So that's an art element in the scene.

Ren
OK. Yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
Sentencing.

Miklos Mayer
And then later you can give choices. You have now two buttons and.

Miklos Mayer
Somewhere there's a choice. Yeah. And now if you have a choice, then you have.

Miklos Mayer
The branching to go to a defense and.

Miklos Mayer
And this will also represent it like this.

Ren
Cool.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Umm.

Miklos Mayer
I think that's all I prepared with.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Ren
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
So I have any more questions? Let's see.

Ren
If you're gonna be looking at more visual novel, like stuff, you may wanna look at Grandpa.

Ren
Just so you have like.

Miklos Mayer
But that's the name.

Ren
Uh, I'll post it in the thing again.

Miklos Mayer
Trump, I like this.

Ren
There you go.

Ren
For for this kind of project I'm a very good uh source of extra stuff.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
But.

Ren
That's just visual novel, but it's still at the because visual novels are kind of sisters to text.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah.

Ren
To text games, it's still.

Ren
Good to see at what they do.

Miklos Mayer
OK, so this is a.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
So this is scripting.

Ren
Very simple simple scripting.

Miklos Mayer
I see.

Ren
Because this is the usual like in the visual novel community, this is like the usual choice for people who just wanna.

Ren
With barely any coding skills who want to build a game.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Uh, just.

Miklos Mayer
Actually.

Ren
I figured you might as well.

Ren
Have the link.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Doesn't hurt you?

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's true.

Miklos Mayer
Actually I will show you something, but is it?

Miklos Mayer
OK, just stop.

Miklos Mayer
Uh, you said that you want something that will generate a.

Miklos Mayer
Ah.

Miklos Mayer
Why did they?

Ren
Ah yes, actually yarn spinners.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, but I think this will be the one. So this is used to write dialogues for games.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
I think let me show quick start.

Miklos Mayer
You can use it in unity.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
UM.

Miklos Mayer
So it's something like this.

Ren
I'll show you the one that I got recommended by someone who did work in the visual novel industry.

Miklos Mayer
Alright.

Ren
Link sent.

Miklos Mayer
Ankle. Yes, that's also I.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Miklos Mayer
I tried it out, yes.

Miklos Mayer
I think it's.

Miklos Mayer
Kind of similar to yours. You know, I think.

Miklos Mayer
So.

Ren
Yeah, that, that, that that's the one I was planning on using for my scripts so.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Yeah, I I I stumbled that points and.

Miklos Mayer
Apart.

Miklos Mayer
And also more choice scripts.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, these these are these were the three script based I looked up which is just clearly screen based and I mean Chinese also quiz.

Miklos Mayer
A sweet face, but.

Ren
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
It's more.

Ren
Yeah, yeah.

Ren
The flow, yeah.

Miklos Mayer
It it has box or or it it said more more visualized a little.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah. OK.

Miklos Mayer
It's like you.

Miklos Mayer
So research this.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, but I think that's all the questions I have.

Miklos Mayer
So I just stopped sharing my screen.

Ren
OK.

Miklos Mayer
And.

Miklos Mayer
OK, I have one more question. Can you recommend anyone who put me would also help me out with my project. Someone who's maybe.

Miklos Mayer
Yes, someone who guys would like to create interactive stories on.

Miklos Mayer
Adventure games.

Ren
I can. I can see about my DND.

Ren
Getting people if you want.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
There might be one or two people in there who might be able to help you.

Miklos Mayer
OK, that's.

Ren
I'll I'll send them a message to ask if they want to help out and then if they do, I'll get you into contact.

Miklos Mayer
Yeah, that's what the date. Thank you.

Ren
Sure, no problem.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Can do.

Ren
Can do.

Miklos Mayer
Later I may create some prototypes and user testing and if you interested to help me out with that later, OK, that's great.

Ren
Look, I I I was in your position.

Ren
A year and a half ago.

Ren
I need to do my due diligence.

Miklos Mayer
I see. OK. Thanks.

Ren
Give back.

Miklos Mayer
Now, if you have time so.

Ren
Well, my my schedule is work eight to five.

Ren
And on a weekend travel to the boyfriend. So.

Ren
If you're fine with that schedule.

Miklos Mayer
Ohh I'd be yes.

Ren
Then there we go. You'll probably be fine.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Thanks.

Ren
No problem.

Miklos Mayer
Uh.

Ren
Hope I was helpful.

Miklos Mayer
Umm yeah, I mean I.

Miklos Mayer
It will come out when I compare the different interviews, etcetera. I think you're the third one, so.

Miklos Mayer
A fortune of the some of the people haven't written back so.

Ren
I'll I'll try and push some people onto maybe maybe I can ask my boyfriend if anyone at work is happy to be interviewed.

Miklos Mayer
I would be happy to have any creative writer so.

Ren
I'll I'll pull my connections. How do you feel about some random Americans?

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
I'll. I'll I'll ask why my former story writing communities as anyone's into that.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Ren
Because I used to be like on a video game like I used to write stories with other people and video games.

Miklos Mayer
Ah.

Ren
So I actually know quite a few people who might still have kept up with the creativeness there.

Miklos Mayer
OK.

Miklos Mayer
OK. Thank you.

Miklos Mayer
That would be very useful.

Ren
Cool.

Miklos Mayer
I guess starting point.
