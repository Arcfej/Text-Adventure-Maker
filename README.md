# Text-Adventure-Maker

This is the project I did for my honours project. The goal of it was to develop a user-friendly web application that assists writers and storytellers in designing and implementing text-based adventure games and making them playable in a mobile application. To achieve this, comparative research on already existing solutions was conducted, and then writers were interviewed to gain insight into their creative process and to understand their needs. These revealed the need for a graph-based editor that requires little technical knowledge and favours simplicity against feature-richness.

The current version is capable of creating branching, or choose your own adventure stories. Feel free to try the editor out here: [Text Adventure Maker](https://text-adventure-maker.pages.dev/)
